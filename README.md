# KinectForPhysics
KinectForPhysics is an augmented reality system for teaching Euclidean vectors in physics and mathematics. The goal of this pedagogical tool is to facilitate userâ€™s understanding of physical concepts, such as magnitude, direction, and orientation, together with basic vector-related operations like addition, subtraction and cross product. The system merges a real world scenario with virtual elements controlled with a practical body-interactive interface.
